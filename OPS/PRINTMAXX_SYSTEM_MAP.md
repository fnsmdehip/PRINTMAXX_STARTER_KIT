## WHAT IT IS

A fully autonomous solopreneur operations system that scrapes intelligence, generates content, manages ventures, deploys assets, and makes strategic decisions 24/7 without human input — running primarily on a $200/mo Claude Max plan via `claude -p` CLI calls through launchd and cron, with a Codex automation layer handling recurring meta-planning and task-queue generation.

The human does: account creation, payments, API keys, posting from personal accounts.
The system does: everything else.

## OPERATING ETHOS (Capital Genesis)

PRINTMAXX operates as a **hedge fund of revenue lanes**, not a single-bet startup.

**Portfolio theory:** 10+ revenue lanes simultaneously. Each lane has ~30% solo success rate. 10 lanes = 97% chance of at least one hit, 70% chance of 3+. By Phase 5, no single method exceeds 30% of total revenue. The portfolio survives any single-method extinction event.

**Cross-pollination:** Every method feeds at least one other. Content → personas → newsletters → flash sales → apps → community → outreach → back to content. Stacked Revenue = Sum(Individual) × Synergy Multiplier (1.3-2.5x) × Automation Factor (1.0-3.0x). Standalone methods are dead weight.

**Shared infrastructure:** Same $240-280/mo tooling drives ALL revenue. Claude Max ($200) generates content, code, research, automation for every lane. Marginal cost per new method → zero. A solopreneur running these independently would spend $1,500+/mo on separate tools.

**Kill ruthlessly, scale winners:**
- Kill: App <$100 MRR after 60 days. Content <500 followers after 90 days. Outbound <2% reply after 3 optimizations.
- Scale: App MRR growing 20%+ at $500+ → paid ads. Content >5% engagement sustained → double frequency. Newsletter >40% open rate at 500+ subs → launch paid tier.

**Reinvestment matrix:** $0-1k → 90% back to business. $1-5k → 80% business. $5-15k → 70% business, 10% index funds, 5% crypto. $15-50k → 50% business, 20% index, 10% crypto, 5% angel. Revenue per hour tracked per method — time flows to highest-ROI lanes.

**Phase-based activation:** Don't start everything at once. Phase 0 = account setup (3-4h human). Phase 1 = first revenue in 72h. Phase 3 unlocks at $1k/mo. Phase 4 at $5k/mo. Phase 5 (empire mode) at $16-57k/mo.

**Execute and log:** The system documents its own operations — but for machine consumption, not human reports. Every action, decision, result goes to structured files (CSVs, JSONL, state JSON) that agents read and act on. No vanity docs.

| Meta planning outputs | `OPS/META_PLAN.json`, `OPS/AUTONOMOUS_TASK_QUEUE.jsonl` | Latest MASTER_OPS-derived plan and queued work |
| CodeRelay local remote bridge | `~/.coderelay/config.json`, `~/.coderelay/bin/coderelay`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.coderelay.plist`, `AUTOMATIONS/coderelay_lan_proxy.py` | Agent-native remote control surface for Codex via Orbit/Anchor. Canonical public origin now points to the tailnet URL; LAN relay on `:8791` remains the same-Wi-Fi fallback for first-run pairing and local rescue. |
| Tailscale userspace transport | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tailscale.userspace.plist`, `AUTOMATIONS/coderelay_tailscale_sync.py`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.coderelay.tailscale-sync.plist` | Private remote-access transport for anywhere access. Userspace daemon + sync loop keep SSH, Serve, and CodeRelay public origin aligned to the live MagicDNS URL. |
| Full GUI fallback | `~/Applications/RustDesk.app`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rustdesk.client.plist` | Full remote desktop/app control layer for “act like I am on the laptop” fallback |
| Remote access doctor | `AUTOMATIONS/remote_access_status.py`, `~/.printmaxx_remote_access.json` | On-demand snapshot of Tailscale, CodeRelay, and RustDesk status. Sync loop now refreshes the private state file automatically. |
| Sanitized carve-out note | `OPS/REMOTE_CONTROL_DAISY_CHAIN.md` | Open-source extraction boundary and operating pattern for the remote-control daisy chain |
| Sanitized open-source kit | `OPEN_SOURCE/remote-control-daisy-chain/` | Repo-ready carve-out with generic scripts, launchd templates, docs, and example state |

**Latest verified Codex layer (2026-03-13):**
- `meta_planner` ran against `PRINTMAXX_MASTER_OPS_ENHANCED_2026-03-03.xlsx`.
- It produced `OPS/META_PLAN.json` and queued 507 tasks into `OPS/AUTONOMOUS_TASK_QUEUE.jsonl`.
- Coverage snapshot: 518 actionable ops, with 101 scripted, 62 LLM tasks, and 355 remaining gaps.
- `twitter_alpha_scraper.py --accounts --limit 12 --days 30` completed live with Brave cookies + Playwright under elevated browser permissions and saved 38 new high-signal entries (`ALPHA22483-ALPHA22520`) to `LEDGER/ALPHA_STAGING.csv`.
- `app_factory_autopilot.py --run --skip-accounts --approval-max 120 --processor-batch 120 --queue-limit 60` completed live and refreshed approval, routing, specs, and the ranked app queue.
- CodeRelay is installed locally at `~/.coderelay`, with `http://127.0.0.1:8790/health` and `/admin/status` verified and Anchor connected to Orbit.
- CodeRelay `publicOrigin` now resolves to `https://printmaxx-control.tail16dddb.ts.net` via `python3 AUTOMATIONS/coderelay_tailscale_sync.py`, and the LAN relay at `AUTOMATIONS/coderelay_lan_proxy.py` remains available as the same-Wi-Fi fallback on `http://192.168.1.172:8791`.
- Latest verified same-Wi-Fi pairing path: `http://192.168.1.172:8791/pair?code=<short-lived-code>` generated successfully at 2026-03-12 03:47 local. Codes are one-time and expire quickly, so mint fresh ones from `/admin` when needed.
- Tailscale userspace transport is live under `com.tailscale.userspace`. Node authenticated as `printmaxx-control.tail16dddb.ts.net` with Tailscale IP `100.70.237.42`, and `tailscale serve status` now confirms `https://printmaxx-control.tail16dddb.ts.net (tailnet only) -> http://127.0.0.1:8790`.
- `AUTOMATIONS/coderelay_tailscale_sync.py` plus `com.coderelay.tailscale-sync` now auto-finish Serve/origin wiring after login and keep `~/.printmaxx_remote_access.json` fresh.
- `AUTOMATIONS/remote_access_status.py` was added as an on-demand doctor for the full remote-control stack.
- RustDesk `1.4.6` is installed in `~/Applications/RustDesk.app` and launched at login via `com.rustdesk.client`, but unattended password/service setup still needs admin-level or manual in-app completion and macOS screen recording/accessibility permissions.
- Sanitized extraction work now lives at `OPEN_SOURCE/remote-control-daisy-chain/` so the daisy-chain concept can be split out without leaking PRINTMAXX business state or private identifiers.

### Op Categories (from ALL OPS MASTER)

```
CONTENT (C01-C20)     — TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, X, Podcast, Newsletter
SERVICE (S01-S08)     — Freelance, Local Biz, Agency, Cold Email, AI Services
APP (A01-A04)         — Portfolio Apps, Vertical SaaS, Chrome Extensions

### Synergy Multiplier System

Ops don't exist in isolation. SYNERGY STACKS define which ops compound:

```
SYN351: Voice AI + Vertical SaaS              — 97 score, 4.5x multiplier
SYN352: Clipper + TikTok Double Monetization   — 96 score, 6.5x multiplier
SYN353: Content Farm + TikTok + FB Reels Arb   — 96 score, 6.2x multiplier
SYN354: Portfolio Apps + Paywall Optimization   — 95 score, 8.7x multiplier
```

Revenue formula: Stacked = Sum(Individual) × Synergy Multiplier × Automation Factor

### Blocker Keys (what's stopping ops)

```
X_MULTI_ACCOUNT_STACK     — Antidetect browser + proxy setup (blocks 15+ content ops)
STORE_ACCOUNT_AND_PAYMENT — App Store + payment processor (blocks app factory)
FIVERR_UPWORK_ACCOUNT     — Freelance platform accounts (blocks service ops)
EMAIL_INFRA               — Email sending infrastructure (blocks outbound)
GUMROAD_ACCOUNT           — Gumroad seller setup (blocks digital products)
STRIPE_ACCOUNT            — Payment processing (blocks direct sales)
```

## REVENUE STATUS

$0. Day 35. The system builds, scrapes, scores, decides, and generates 24/7.
The bottleneck is human activation of payment/distribution channels.

**Unblocked in ~85 min:** Stripe (5min) + Gmail MCP (5min) + Twitter profile (10min) + Gumroad 13 products (30min) + TikTok (30min) + Cloudflare (5min).

**Pipeline ready:** 13 digital products built. 40 posts queued. 1,110 leads. 16 live sites. 20 ecom arb products (27-66% margins). 12 freelance opps. 182 ops mapped with automation scores.

## RESTRUCTURE V2 — NEW COMPONENTS (2026-03-13)

Source: PRINTMAXX_RESTRUCTURE_V2.xlsx — gap analysis from metaswarm, Swan AI, OpenClaw, IH patterns, ccswarm, wshobson/agents

### SOUL.md (Behavioral Identity)
```
AUTOMATIONS/SOUL.md — behavioral directives for all agents
  Injected via: intelligence_router.py → get_intelligence() → result["soul_directives"]
  Also: _common.py → get_soul() for direct reads
  Core: "be resourceful before asking", "execute don't deliberate", "every output has a consumer"
```

### Blocking State Gates (T014 — BEADS pattern)
```
AUTOMATIONS/gates.py — deterministic state machine for pipeline quality control
  States: PENDING → IMPLEMENTING → VALIDATING → REVIEWING → APPROVED | REJECTED | HUMAN_REQUIRED
  DB: LEDGER/printmaxx_gates.db (SQLite, survives session restart)
  Rule: NO path from REJECTED → APPROVED without human_override=True
  Consumers: content pipeline, lead outreach, ecomm arb, CEO agent
```

### Cross-Model Adversarial Review (T013)
```
.claude/external-tools.yaml — model routing config (Codex/Gemini stubs)
AUTOMATIONS/MODEL_ROUTING_CONFIG.json — evaluator_writer=Sonnet, evaluator_reviewer=Opus
  Rule: agent that writes output NEVER reviews own output
  Budget: $2/task, $20/session caps
```

### Swan AI GTM Agents (T015)
```
AUTOMATIONS/shakespeare_agent.py — content gen (Sonnet, daily 8am)
  Arc: Attack Outdated Belief → Evidence → New Framework → Data → CTA
  Output: CONTENT/linkedin/ + CONTENT/social/posting_queue/

AUTOMATIONS/observer_agent.py — engagement monitoring (Haiku, every 2h)
  Scoring: agency founder (10) → agency employee (7) → consultant (5) → other (2)
  Output: LEDGER/INBOUND_LEADS.csv (score > 7 = lead, score > 9 = immediate alert)

AUTOMATIONS/quinn_agent.py — warm outreach gen (Sonnet, triggered by observer)
  Output: LEDGER/OUTREACH_QUEUE.csv (warm messages referencing specific engagement)
  A/B: 50% Quinn warm vs 50% standard cold
```

### Task Dependency Graph (T016)
```
AUTOMATIONS/task_graph.py — DAG-based dependency chains
  CHAIN_ALPHA_PIPELINE: scraper → alpha_processor → intel_router → ceo_agent
  CHAIN_CONTENT: shakespeare → evaluator → cross_model_reviewer → social_poster
  CHAIN_LEAD: observer → quinn → lead_machine → compliance_scanner → send
  CHAIN_ARB: ecomm_arb → evaluator → HUMAN_GATE → asset_deployer
  State: LEDGER/printmaxx_gates.db (task_graph table)
```

### Git Worktree Isolation (T017)
```
AUTOMATIONS/worktree_manager.py — parallel agent file isolation
  Creates: ../printmaxx-{name}/ worktrees
  Strategies: last-write-wins (content), human-review (revenue files)
  State: AUTOMATIONS/agent/worktree_state.json
```

### Parallel Challenger Review (T023)
```
AUTOMATIONS/challenger_agents.py — adversarial review of CEO decisions
  Devil's Advocate | Risk Assessor | Market Reality Checker
  Trigger: MAJOR decisions (PROMOTE > $100, KILL > 30d active, CREATE > 10h build)
  2+ OBJECTIONs → PENDING_HUMAN_APPROVAL.jsonl
  Log: LEDGER/DECISION_REVIEWS.jsonl
```
